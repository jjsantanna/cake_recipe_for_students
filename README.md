# "Cake Recipe" for Students (from UTwente)
In this repository, I make available a "Recipe" for (B.Sc. and M.Sc.) students on how to make: (1) research proposal, (2) research topics, and (3) final paper or thesis; in latex.

## For B.Sc. Students

## For M.Sc Students
The final assignment of a Master course is composed of 2 parts: (1) literature study, sometimes called as research topics (20ECs) and (2) the final thesis (40ECs). Sometimes you do one of these two parts as an internship in a company. 

0) Send to BOZ the Research Topics grade (BOZ CS (CES) <boz-cs@utwente.nl>)
1) Registered in Mobility for your Final Project (you should have registered at the start).
2) Send the green-light notice to BOZ (BOZ CS (CES) <boz-cs@utwente.nl>)

### Electrical Engineering?

I will request you to give a presentation for a closed group of researchers. Then you will start working on your thesis. 

# MOST IMPORTANT, besides the assessment forms, what grade do you consider an external reviewer would give to your report?
