# "Cake Recipe" for Students (from UTwente)
In this repository, I make available a "Recipe" for (B.Sc. and M.Sc.) students on how to make: (1) research proposal, (2) research topics, and (3) final paper or thesis; in latex.

## For B.Sc. Students

## For M.Sc Students
The final assignment of a Master course is composed of 2 parts: (1) literature study, sometimes called as research topics (20ECs) and (2) the final thesis (40ECs). Sometimes you do one of these two parts as an internship in a company.

I will request you to give a presentation for a closed group of researchers. Then you will start working on your thesis.
